# Google Maps and Travel Analysis

## Project Overview

To design a "PlanMyTrip" application that allows users to filter destinations based on weather preferences. Once this has been selected by a client, the information will be used to identify potential destinations of travel and nearby accomodation choices. From the destination list, users will choose a four-city travel itinerary. With the use of different Google APIs a marker map showing the four cities will be created along with a travel route map showing three different transportation modes - driving(green), biking(blue) and walking(green). Each transportation method is colour coded, as above, for ease of view.

- Deliverables:
  1. Connect using OpenWeatherMap, retrieve weather data and export the results in a CSV file.
  2. Create a client travel map with various destinations and nearby hotels using Google Maps. 
  3. Create a four-city travel itinerary and associated marker map with Google Maps.

## Resources
- Current Weather Data: Open Weather API
- Google Maps REST APIs: Places API, Directions API, Javascript API
- Data files created from above APIs: WeatherPy_Database.csv, WeatherPy_vacation.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.10, Visual Studio Code 1.56.2, Jupyter Notebook Server 6.3.0
